# ILDPS
The Multi-Agent-Based Intelligent Learning Development Platform is an advanced educational system designed to enhance smart learning through the integration of multi-agent technologies. This platform leverages the collaborative power of multiple intelligent agents to provide personalized, adaptive, and dynamic learning experiences for users.

✅ Course Video Viewing and Learning:
Students can access and study course videos anytime, gaining a deeper understanding of key concepts through structured video materials.

✅ Course Video Summarization:
The system automatically extracts key points from the video descriptions and generates concise summaries, helping students quickly grasp essential content for both pre-class preparation and post-class review.

✅ Exercise and Solution Analysis:
For exercises such as coding problems and multiple-choice questions, the system provides detailed explanations to help students understand the problem-solving process. It can also generate similar practice questions to reinforce learning. With intelligent code structure recognition (including classes, attributes, methods, and functions) combined with static code analysis, the system performs fine-grained code assessments, covering design compliance checks, functional completeness evaluation, and line-by-line correctness analysis. Additionally, it can generate questions and explanations based on specific courses or knowledge points upon request.

✅ Course Q&A Assistance:
Students can ask questions at any time during the learning process, and the system provides accurate technical guidance and conceptual clarifications, ensuring continuous support.

✅ Learning Progress Tracking and Analysis:
The system continuously records student learning behaviors, such as study frequency, duration, and points of confusion. After completing a course, it generates a comprehensive learning report that visually presents progress, highlights weak areas, and supports personalized learning strategies. By analyzing course watch time and exercise completion rates, the system uses large-model-powered analysis on the course knowledge base to deliver tailored learning insights.
